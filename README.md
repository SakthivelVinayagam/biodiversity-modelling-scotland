Biodiversity Modelling (Ecology)

Overview

Investigated ecological variation and biodiversity trends across multiple taxonomic groups in Scotland using regression modelling.

Dataset
	•	Ecological survey datasets across six taxonomic groups (e.g., bees).

Methodology
	•	Hypothesis testing and correlation analysis.
	•	Linear regression models with interaction terms.
	•	Two-fold cross-validation for robustness.

Technology Stack

R · ggplot2 · dplyr · tidyr · caret · psych

Results
	•	Built predictive models for bee population trends.
	•	Explained biodiversity variation using regression analysis.
